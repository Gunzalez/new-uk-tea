            <p>No doubt you have your own favourite tea brand or blend, but do look through this section and discover other wonderful teas to go out and try...</p>

<p>Although tea was discovered in China nearly five thousand years ago, it took several thousand years before the plant, botanical name Camellia sinensis, found its way to other parts of the world.</p>

<p>Today, tea is grown on a commercial scale in approximately three dozen countries and, in each country, the product makes a significant contribution to the economy of the agricultural sector.</p>

<p>Tea is grown from China to Argentina, Nepal to South Africa, and, next to water, tea is the worlds most consumed drink.</p>

<p>Tea scientists have been working closely with nature for the past two hundred years to produce new tea cultivars that can thrive in difficult conditions like drought yet continue to produce satisfactory yields that deliver the quality that consumers expect.</p>

<p>There are approximately 1,500 different varieties of tea, all offering interesting and varied style´s, taste and colour. The character of tea, like wine, is influenced by the elevation of the garden, the soil, wind conditions and temperature and, of course, the quality of the plucking. With so many teas to choose from there is a lifetime of enjoyable exploration ahead.</p>

                        <p>Known as the birthplace of tea, for hundreds of years China produced the only teas known to the western world. Although consuming much of her own production, China still accounts for over 18.5% of world exports.  China has 2,649,840 hectares planted with tea.</p>

                        <p>As well as black teas, China produces five other principal types for which the country is famous: Green, Oolong, White, Flavoured and Compressed teas.  With some exceptions - such as Lapsang Souchong, Gunpowder and Keemun - most teas from China are not easily found in the general marketplace.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Green Tea</h3>
                <p>Many green China teas are still traditionally made by hand using methods that have been handed down from generation to generation.  However, more and more teas are now made in mechanised factories.  Green teas are totally unoxidised (compared to black teas which are fully oxidised) and so the first stage of the manufacturing process is to kill any enzymes that would otherwise cause oxidation to take place.  </p>
                <p>To de-enzyme them, the freshly plucked leaves are either steamed (to make 'sencha-type teas) or tumbled quickly in a wok or panning machine (to make pan-fired teas) and are then rolled by hand or machine to give the leaf a particular appearance - some teas are twisted, some curved, some rolled into pellets, etc.  To remove all but 2-3% of the remaining water, the tea is then dried in hot ovens or over charcoal </p>

                <h3 class="title">White Tea</h3>
                <p>White teas traditionally come from China's Fujian province and are made from leaf buds and leaves of the Da Bai (Big White) tea varietal by the simplest process of all teas.  Very young new leaf buds and baby leaves are simply gathered and dried - often in the sun.</p>
                <p>The manufacturing process includes no withering, no steaming, no rolling, no oxidising and no shaping.  The best known white teas are Pai Mu Tan (White Peony) which is made using new leaf buds and a few very young leaves, and Yin Zhen (Silver Needles) which is made from just the new leaf buds.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Puerh Tea</h3>
                <p>The official Chinese definition for Puerh tea is "Products fermented from green tea of big leaves picked within Yunnan province".  However, even Chinese specialists cannot agree on the true definition but, in general terms, Puerh teas are teas from Yunnan that are aged for up to 50 years in humidity- and temperature-controlled conditions to produce teas that have a typically earthy, mature, smooth flavour and aroma.</p>

                        <p>India is one of the main tea growers, exporting more than 12% of the world's tea and with 566,660 hectares under cultivation. Although indigenous to the Assam region, the first commercially produced teas were raised from seeds brought from China.</p>

                        <p>By the 1840s, India was producing regular shipments for sale at auction in London, and gradually the planting of estates grew throughout the country from Nilgiri in the south to Darjeeling in the north.</p>

                <p>The plantations range from low-grown areas (sea level up to 2000ft) to high-grown (more than 4000 ft high). Generally plucked from March to October, each area produces teas of distinctive character. The Tea Board of India has endorsed several speciality blends so that their quality and consistency is assured.</p>
                <p>To de-enzyme them, the freshly plucked leaves are either steamed (to make 'sencha-type teas) or tumbled quickly in a wok or panning machine (to make pan-fired teas) and are then rolled by hand or machine to give the leaf a particular appearance - some teas are twisted, some curved, some rolled into pellets, etc.  To remove all but 2-3% of the remaining water, the tea is then dried in hot ovens or over charcoal </p>

                        <p>One of the oldest of the African producers, Kenya has a history of tea dating back to 1903, when tea seeds from India were first planted on a two acre farm. Today, Kenya has 203,006 hectares under cultivation by smallholders (shambas), under the protection of the Kenya Tea Development Authority, and tea producing companies in the public and private sector. Kenya exports over 443,461 tonnes of tea per year (25% of world exports). Kenya's equatorial climate allows tea growing all year round.</p>

<p>The teas are very bright, colourful, with a reddish coppery tint and a pleasant brisk flavour. Kenya speciality tea is ideal as a drink for any time of day or night and is particularly ideal with beef and horseraddish or ham sandwiches and rich chocolate cake.  In the after dinner slot Kenya tea will enhance the flavour of a smoked cheese taken with Drambuie.  Kenya teas are also blended into many famous British brands.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Malawi</h3>
                <p>Malawi is the pioneer of tea growing in Africa, with production first starting commercially in the 1880s in Mulanje. Now exporting some 31,000 tonnes annually, Malawi has a 1.7% share of world exports and is mainly responsible for the spread of tea cultivation in Africa. Malawi was the first African country to adopt the cloning method of estate refurbishment. Although Malawi teas are not so well known as speciality teas, their superb colour and brightness means they are used in the blending of leading British tea brands.</p>


                <h3 class="title">Zimbabwe</h3>
                <p>Tea production in Zimbabwe could begin commercially only after the successful establishment of irrigated tea estates. With an average annual rainfall of not more than 26 inches per annum, as opposed to the 50 plus inches per annum usually required, irrigation is essential to continuous growth. Zimbabwe now exports over 11,000 tonnes of tea per year from 5,500 hectares. Today, tea is a "controlled" commodity in Zimbabwe so that its quality and industry growth are protected.</p>
